  description: `
    This is an archive of my first development projects. Although all of these projects are single page applications. They 
    highlight the development of skills from the beginning. The first portion of my collection covers Front-end 
    Libraries. I used mainly React to make theses applications, but I also mixed it with jQuery, Sass, Bootstrap, and 
    Material Design. Code can be found directly in each pen or in its individual repository within Github for each project.
