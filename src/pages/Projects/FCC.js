  description: `
    The Free Code Camp project collections represent my very initial development projects. Although all of these 
    projects are single-page applications, they highlight the critical fundamental skills. The first portion of my 
    collection covers Front-End Libraries. I mainly used React to make these applications, but I also mixed in jQuery, 
    Sass, Bootstrap, and Material Design. The code for each project can be found directly in each Codepen project or its 
    repository within Github.
