    `
    YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that emphasizes user
    authentication and full CRUD operations a database. This project
    came from a code-along tutorial from a Udemy course as a final
    project. The intricacies of this project showed me the logic and processes behind an entire web page.
    The application runs on Node/Express and renders server side. The view runs on EJS (Embeded JavaScript). Other 
    notable tools include Passport for encryption and authentication, MongoDB hosted by Mongo Atlas, and Heroku for hosting.
