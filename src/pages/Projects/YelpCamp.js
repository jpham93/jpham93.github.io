    `
      YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that emphasizes user authentication and full CRUD operations in a 
      database. This project came from a code-along tutorial from a Udemy course as a final
      project. The intricacies of this project showed me the logic and processes behind a full stack web page.
      The application runs on Node/Express and server-side renders. The view runs on EJS (Embedded JavaScript). Other 
      important tools include Passport for encryption and authentication, MongoDB hosted by Mongo Atlas, and Heroku for hosting.
