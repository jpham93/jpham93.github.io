  description:
    `
    This is an internal project developed by the software development team at VTA. This Progressive Web Application tends
    to help customer provide feedback faster and easier to our organization. Quicker and shorter feedback cycles is vital 
    to not only the IT departments Agile principles, but to the entire VTA organization itself. My involvement began 
    during the skeleton phase of the SDLC. Since a designer already produced an Invsion mockup of the entire application
    before my arrival, I jumped straight into coding pure UI/UX with the senior engineer. That was my first exposure to
    Angular alongside Ionic and therefore, Cordova. This was also my first professional workflow with Github where I 
    properly branched new features, made Pull Requests, and went through code reviews. We have finished the skeleton 
    phase and are now developing functionality and backend logic using a symfony server with NoSQL database 
    (Elasticsearch).
