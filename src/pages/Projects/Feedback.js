  description:
    `
    Feedback App is an internal project developed by the web development team at VTA. This progressive web application (PWA) intends
    to expedite customer feedback to our organization. Quicker and shorter feedback cycles are vital to not only the IT departments Agile principles but to the entire VTA organization itself. My involvement began during the skeleton phase of the SDLC. Since a designer already produced an Invision mockup of the whole application
    before my arrival, I jumped straight into coding pure UI/UX with the senior engineer. That was my first exposure to
    Angular alongside Ionic and, therefore, Cordova. The skeleton phase was also my first professional workflow with Github, where I 
    correctly branched new features, made Pull Requests, and went through code reviews. We have finished the skeleton 
    phase and are now developing functionality and backend logic using a Symfony server with NoSQL database 
    (Elasticsearch).
