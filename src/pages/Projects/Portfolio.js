      This entire web page is one of my projects itself! However, I wanted to highlight it, because this is my first 
      project outside of my internship, where I applied proper Github workflow. Using knowledge from my VTA
      internship, I documented the planning and execution through a series of Github issues, branches, and pull 
      requests. This entire project runs on React and Semantic UI. This project also uses React Router to render web 
      pages dynamically. I deployed this project in an AWS EC2 instance. The Github button below links to this website's 
      source code.
