    This entire web page is one of my projects itself! However, I wanted to highlight it, because this is my first 
    project outside of my internship where I applied proper Github workflow. Using knowledge from my VTA
    internship, I documentated the planning and execution through a series of Github issues, branches, and pull request.
    This entire project runs on React with a React implemented Semantic UI. This project also uses React router to 
    dynamically render React components web pages. This project is deployed in two places, Github Pages, and an 
    AWS EC2 instance. A link of this website's source code can be found in the Github icon.
