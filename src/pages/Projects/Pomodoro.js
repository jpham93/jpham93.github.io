    `
    Pomodoro Clock was a remake of a previous project that I did for Free Code Camp's online course. The older version 
    used React and was web-based. However, as an educational experiment, I wanted to remake the same application using 
    Angular. With the gained Angular experience at my internship, I used the Angular framework to create a mobile 
    version, and I plan to continue further development for an iOS release in the future.
