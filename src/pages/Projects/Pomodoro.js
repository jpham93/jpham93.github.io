    Pomodoro Clock was a remake of a previous project that I did for Free Code Camp's online course. The older 
    version used React and was web based. However, as a educational experiment, I wanted to
    remake the same application using Angular. With the gained Angular experience at my internship, I used the 
    Angular framework to create a mobile version and I plan to release this version to the Apple Store soon.
