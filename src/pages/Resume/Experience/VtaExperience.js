              <p>VTA is developing a progressive web application to enable customers
                tunnel direct feedback to the customer service department. Because
                this application is built internally, I had the pleasure of
                participating in its development cycle from the early planning stages
                to executing code implementations. My involvement in the development
                process includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Creating work packages for our application's roadmap using
                  Agile Epics, Stories, Features, and Tasks. Each task was managed
                  through Open Project.
                </li>
                <li>Coding mockups to consumer specifications defined in Invasion.</li>
                <li>Working and communicating with our stakeholders to</li>
                <li>Executing work packages by creating features and adding to code
                  shared repository via Pull Requests.
                </li>
                <li>Using and testing with local Elasticsearch Index to plan and
                  transform JSON formatted data to Elastic search documentation.

                strengthen, retool, and keep lifelong learners current with the
                latest development technology. I got to experience both internal and
                external workshops in my internship.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Attended MuleSoft's workshop and created APIs using their Anypoint Platform.</li>
                <li>Attened our internal teams Technology Learning Series (TLS) and
                  learned about Wordpress, Agile Methodolgies, etc. â€“ I
                  actually used the gained knowledge from Wordpress to create a
                  landing page for my mom's business.
